                <h2>HOTEL SAVOY - BORACAY</h2>
                <p>
                  It was okay, but wouldn't stay here again. The hotel is far from the city, good restaurants, beautiful beaches, and most activities. If you're looking for peace, isolation, and just want to relax by the pool without going to the beach, then this place might be suitable for you. While the facilities are brand new and the pool is excellent, the required shuttle rides to get anywhere (like D'Mall or White Beach) add significant travel time and expense to every outing. It feels disconnected from the main Boracay experience, which might be exactly what some want, but it was too inconvenient for us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Awesome experience! We're definitely coming back! The place especially the pool was a hit with my son, and it really felt like we are just at home. The staff went above and beyond, treating us like family and offering excellent advice on local tours and transport around Panglao. The rooms are clean, spacious, and the kitchenette was extremely useful for a longer family stay. It’s a quiet and secure spot that offers incredible value, making it the perfect family sanctuary after a busy day exploring the Chocolate Hills and beaches.

                <h2 class="margin-top-1">HOTEL SUNSET BAY - LA UNION</h2>
                <p>
                  Hotel Sunset Bay truly lives up to its name! The view from our balcony at the end of the day was absolutely breathtaking—the best sunset in San Fernando City, hands down. While it's right near the airport road, the soundproofing was surprisingly good, and we slept wonderfully. The rooms were modern and spotlessly clean. It’s not right on the popular Urbiztondo strip, but the location is ideal if you have a car, giving you quick access to the city center and a peaceful retreat afterward. The staff was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend for a relaxing, high-value stay in La Union.

                <h2 class="margin-top-1">HOTEL COSTA PACIFICA - BALER</h2>
                <p>
                  This hotel is a Baler landmark for a reason. Located right on the Pacific coast, Costa Pacifica offers that perfect, slightly wild, surfing town vibe. Our room had a great view of Sabang Beach. While the interior isn't ultra-modern, it has a solid, comfortable, and distinctly Baler charm. The pool area is fantastic after a long day of trying to catch waves. They offer surfing lessons right on site, which was a huge bonus! The breakfast buffet was hearty. Just a note: Baler is remote, and you can feel that raw Pacific energy here, which we loved. If you're coming to surf and explore, this is the place.

                <h2 class="margin-top-1">HOTEL L Cafe Restobar & Lyn's Guest House - SIQUIJOR</h2>
                <p>
                  If you want to experience the true, laid-back Siquijor life, this is the place. It's a combination of a cozy guest house and a lively restobar, making it the perfect hub for both relaxing and meeting people. The rooms at Lyn's Guest House were simple, clean, and offered great value. The real gem is the L Cafe Restobar—amazing food, great cocktails, and a genuinely friendly local crowd that hangs out there. The staff, including Lyn herself, treated us like family, providing tips for touring the island's waterfalls and 'mystical' spots. It's perfectly located in San Juan, right where you want to be. Will definitely be back!
